# Ekicho

## LineListView.swift

This SwiftUI view displays a scrollable list of Tokyo train lines for the Ekicho iOS app. Each line is shown as a card with the line name, a circular color indicator, a label showing the number of stations visited, and a horizontal progress bar. Tapping a card navigates to a StationListView for that line. The layout is optimized for readability on iPhone 15 Pro Max. The file also includes a reusable LineCardView component for each card.
